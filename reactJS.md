What is React.js ? "A Javascript library for building user interfaces."

React is a library that allows devs to build reusable pieces of code (components) in a quick and easy manner. A lot of popular websites are built with React on top (Netflix, Fb, instagram, Scotch IO)

Why would you use React.js? Scalability, open sources, allows for parts of user interface to render without refreshing entire page, and all in all, it's simple.

What are components ? "Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen." - React Docs

Components are reuseable pieces of code. They are very useful for quick modifications to the front end while maintaining uniformity.

What is JSX ? "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements." -W3Schools

JSX is not required to be used by React, but it does make it easier. It allows devs to have a centralized location to render components in the Dom.

What are props ? "Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes." -W3 School
Props, short for properties are are immutable parts of components. Their "options" if you think about a car.

What is state ? The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. Can change over time.
