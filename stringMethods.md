_charAt_
MDN Description: "The String object's charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset into the string."

My Description: A string method that utilizes the index of an array to create a new array with the UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format)

How it works:
charAt(index)

index
An integer between 0 and str.length - 1. If the index cannot be converted to the integer or no index is provided, the default is 0, so the first character of str is returned.

Examples:
const str = new String( "This is string" )
str.charAt(0) //"T"
str.charAt(1) // "h"
str.charAt(2) // "i"
str.charAt(3) // "s"
